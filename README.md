# Congress-Search-iOS-App

This is an iOS Mobile application, which will have following features:

## A slide out menu which will provide access to the different screens:

1. Legislators
2. Bills
3. Committee
4. Favorites

## Self-defined UI and navigators for data searching and detail checking

## CoreData for user to add, delete, search and modify favorite information

Each element in this application is created programmatically, without creating more storyboard. The slide out menu is implemented by the animation character of the viewer component.

The server used in this appication is same to that in Congress-Information-Search-Website. The application requests data from the server and it returns the same contents as the website do.

The application uses several libraries from cocoapods. Please import following libraries before running the application:

1. [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)
2. [SwiftSpinner](https://github.com/icanzilb/SwiftSpinner)
3. [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
